# Medical-Data-Visualizer

The Medical Data Visualizer project involves cleaning and analyzing a medical dataset to uncover trends and insights related to the health of a population. 

The project requires using Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating visualizations, such as histograms and bar charts. These visualizations help in identifying key patterns, correlations, and other aspects of the data, such as age distribution, medical conditions, and treatment outcomes. This project is designed to strengthen skills in both data analysis and data visualization.
